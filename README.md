# 2D Sand Funnel Simulation
## Intro
This program was created for my Bachelor Project at EPFL (Switzerland ). This is an Introduction to Discrete Modelling. The Simulation is composed of material points which interacts using physic equations. Gravity, spring repulsion and friction are implemented. 
## The Swift Program
This is a MacOs App coded in Swift 4. The program provide an User Graphical Interface. It use Core Graphics to display the simulation. To display charts and a progress Indicator I used the [Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts)  Library from danielgindi.
